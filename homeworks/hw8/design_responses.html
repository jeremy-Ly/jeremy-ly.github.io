						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that sneaky usage of design to coerce users into doing something they aren't intentional about is called Dark Patterns. I learned that these Dark Patterns can be very advanced and intricate, helping them manipulate users. There are many different forms and types of Dark Patterns used, from web to paper.  </p>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was how they told us about Dark Pattern's functionality and its intricacy. It was interesting how they mentioned the usage of psychology to manipulate users into doing things. I found it interesting that Dark Patterns were another way to classify bad design because of its unethical approach to creating a poor user exeperience.</p>
