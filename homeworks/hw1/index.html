    <p>Hello! My name is Jeremy and I am a third-year transfer student from Oakland, CA. I love to play basketball and travel with my family. When I'm not cramming all of my last-minute homework, I'm typically playing basketball at RSF or at home in bed. Looking forward to learning more Web Design!</p>

        <li>The article taught me to view websites from a different perspective. They suggest that we focus on how certain websites are structured for their appeal. Rather than just mindlessly using a website or app, focus on its functionality, spacing, aesthetics, etc.</li>
        <li>My favorite part of the article was when they used spotify as an example. I found it interesting to view spotify, an app that I use daily, in a different perspective rather than mindlessly using it. It was interesting to see how they structure things to create a better aesthetic and user experience.</li>
        <li>"By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
